# Intro

Ladies and gentlemen, today we would like to take you on a journey. A journey into the lives of the millions of disabled individuals who aspire to live their lives just like us, who can talk, move, and interact with the world around them.

## Problem

Among the 500 thousand disabled individuals in HK, let's share the moment with one such individual, Christy. She lives in a world she cannot interact with. She lives with a body that can't move easily.

What if we have a device that can help her? A device that can help Christy to send a text to mom that she is missing her, or finally stop depending on others to simply turn off the lights before going to sleep? What if this was possible in the near future?

Angus: Well, the future is here. (comes with the headband, and places it on Hazel)

## Features

### Introducing Sixth Sense

An advanced brain control interface that has an EEG headband and a companion app. Users can use this app to execute commands, by simple actions like blinking.

It gives users independence, allowing them to interact with their environment through smart devices. It also monitors their health, notifying trusted contacts in case of an emergency.

# Transition

## So how does all this work?

## Technical Aspect

Sixth Sense uses a four-step process to remove barriers to digital accessibility.

1. It captures brainwave signals through forehead-mounted electrodes.
2. A microcontroller processes these signals and transmits them to the smartphone.
3. Our signal processing module filters out noise and extracts meaningful data.
4. Lastly - and this is where the magic happens - our model, based on cutting-edge AI research by Harvard Medical School, recognizes patterns in brainwaves and translates them into precise commands, allowing users like Christy to communicate and control their environment with their thoughts alone.

# Business Model

Now, we are looking at a market worth 175 billion dollars, and our target users, the verbally and mobility impaired, account for 40% of it.

Our product, priced competitively below market rates, delivers great value for those relying on this functionality, and we also offer advanced features through a subscription model.

In the future, our strategy is to collaborate with more than 30 companies linked to the PHAB Association, and medical institutions and universities, in order to grow and expand our product globally.

# Team

To build our vision, our team from top universities in HK, comprises people specializing in hardware development, software engineering, and business development. We aim to empower the disabled community through EEG technology. This is why we are committed to creating a product that's not just technologically advanced but also deeply empathetic to the users' needs.

# Social Impact

Honorable judges, Sixth Sense has the power to impact the lives of up to a billion people needing assistance around the world. Our work aligns with the UNâ€™s SDG goals, ensuring our product contributes to a more inclusive and equitable world.

The problem we address is not just about disability, it's about human dignity. Every person deserves the right to express themselves and to interact with the world around them. The future of accessibility is within our reach, and with your support and funding, we can make it a reality and transform the lives of millions like Christy, one blink at a time.
